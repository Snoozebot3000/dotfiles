My personal tmux config
=========================

My evoloving [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) configuration to get my systems setup quickly

Features
------------ 
- "C-a" prefix instead of "C-b"
- Split commands have been replaced to be more memorable
..- '-' instead of '"' for horizontal split
..- '|' instead of '%' for a vertical split
- Fast pane switching using the meta character 'Alt' and a direction `Alt-<direction>` i.e. `Alt-right` without the prefix
- Pane selection with a mouse for easy use by people not familiar with the keybindings
- Turn of automatic Pane renaming so that you can easily keep track of panes by renaming with `,`
- Start pane and windows with an index of 1
- Open new windows in the current path
- Various design changes for colors and notifications
<<<<<<< HEAD
